<div style="text-align: justify">

I am a postdoc at PROSYS at the Technical University of Denmark, working on monitoring and scale-up of bioprocesses integrating process knowledge from the micro to macroscale. My research interests include complex dynamical systems, pattern formation, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

I am intrigued on how to incorporate model knowledge in machine learning systems, and produce systems which can hypothesize and test those hypotheses, sequentially and systematically. Building a notion of causality into such systems is essential for them to understand differences between correlations and causation. While it is claimed in literature that <em>Correlation does not imply Causation</em>, it is often overlooked that <em>Correlations may imply Causation</em>. The question really is when!
